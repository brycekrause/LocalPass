## Local Password Manager

# What's wrong with the password manager I am using now?
Password managers, designed to securely store and manage a user's various passwords, can still be vulnerable to data breaches. A primary risk is that they consolidate multiple passwords into a single access point; if that point is compromised, all stored passwords are exposed.

# Why use a local password manager?
A local password manager enhances security by storing sensitive credentials entirely on the userâ€™s device, reducing the risk of data breaches associated with cloud storage. Since the data never leaves the local environment, it is not susceptible to remote hacking attempts that target centralized servers.
