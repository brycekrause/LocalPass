## What's wrong with the password manager I am using now? 💳🔓
While traditional password managers do store and manage a user’s various passwords, they often rely on cloud storage, making them susceptible to data breaches and remote hacking attempts. Additionally, relying on cloud services introduces the risk of service outages, leaving users unable to access their passwords.

## Why use a local password manager? 🏡🔐
A local password manager enhances security by storing sensitive credentials entirely on the user’s device, reducing the risk of data breaches associated with cloud storage. Since the data never leaves the local environment, it is not susceptible to remote hacking attempts that target centralized servers.
